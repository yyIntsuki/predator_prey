# Predator Prey Project

## Introduction

This project plans to implement the Predator Prey project, with additions of other factors to simulate disease spread, learning behaviors, and other could-have factors under the specified time frame given to the project.

## Problem and Goal

The project seeks to address the limitations of the traditional predator-prey model, which omits many ecological factors like disease spread, genetic diversity and adaptive behavior. Existing models usually focus on basic predator-prey population changes without considering other ecological factors.

The main tool we use is the GAMA platform, which uses the GAma Modeling Language (GAML) as its dedicated language. Which is suitable since this is a derivative work from the Predator Prey model provided by the GAMA platform.

### Must have

* Prey and predators
* Vegetation
* Simulation of disease spread

### Should have

* Genetic traits

### Could have

* Learning behaviors
* Seasonal effects
* Environmental entities

## File structure

This repository covers the main project folder used in GAma. The models folder is mainly used, and stores the models for species, vegetation cells,and simulation.
